# Focus
No Distractions == Higher Grades!

This is meant to run a simple loop for an Arduino, which I wired some LEDs to. 
The purpose is to have them switch on and off, to point out whether its study time or break time. 

I want to modify the code so that I can eventually add the following:

Microphone: dictate to arduino when to "start" studying so that program begins on voice command
            also a pause dictator (more on that)
Small Speaker: so that it has some audible notification that "studying" has begun
Simple UI: I want there to also be an interface where the user can interact with the arduino so that they can set their own personal
           timers, or just be able to control the lighting speeds for effects.
           
If effects were to be implemented, I would use the microphone eventually for some music function so that the lights would play along with the music.
